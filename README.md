ALPHA STAGE!<br>
No bugs have been identified in the code as of now. Also, there are more features to be implemented but the essential functionalities are already there.<br>
<b>Description:</b> Implemented via JFrame GUI: character insertion/deletion (utilizing doubly-linked-lists constructed of ArrayLists), cursor-reposition (w/ left/right arrow-keys), line-wrap, undo/redo (utilizing stacks for edit-tracking), persistent storage.<br>
<b>Practice mission:</b> Constructing LinkedLists out of ArrayLists; coordinating between GUI and behind-the-scenes; the GUI itself; user-input processing; OOP; persistent-storage management; stacks (for undo/redo)

Undo key-combination: Ctrl+Z (Windows/Linux) or Command+Z (macOS)<br>
Redo key-combination: Ctrl+Y (Windows/Linux) or Command+Y (macOS)<br>

To do: implementing word-wrapping (not just general line-wrapping), adding features for down/up arrow key, changing the cursor-position in response to mouse actions, having the GUI only redraw the line, not the whole document 

Most of the project was developed on September 6-11, 18, 23, and 26, 2025.
