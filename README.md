ALPHA STAGE! The code seems to be free of glitches, but it's not certain. Also, there are more features to be implemented but the essential functionalities are already there.<br>
<b>Description:</b> Implemented in Java: JFrame GUI, character insertion/deletion, cursor-position change (using left/right arrow keys), DoublyLinkedList, line-wrapping, undo/redo, persistent storage.<br>
<b>Practice mission:</b> Constructing LinkedLists out of ArrayLists; coordinating between GUI and behind-the-scenes; the GUI itself; user-input processing; OOP; persistent-storage management

To do: undo/redo, implementing word-wrapping (not just general line-wrapping), adding features for down/up arrow key, changing the cursor-position in response to mouse actions

Most of the project was developed within September 6-11, 2025.


Thank you for your attention.<br>
