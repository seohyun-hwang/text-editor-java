ALPHA STAGE! 1 bug has been identified in the code. Also, there are more features to be implemented but the essential functionalities are already there.<br>
<b>Description:</b> Implemented in Java: JFrame GUI, character insertion/deletion, cursor-position change (using left/right arrow keys), DoublyLinkedList, line-wrapping, undo/redo, persistent storage.<br>
<b>Practice mission:</b> Constructing LinkedLists out of ArrayLists; coordinating between GUI and behind-the-scenes; the GUI itself; user-input processing; OOP; persistent-storage management; stacks (for undo/redo)

Undo key-combination: Ctrl+Z (Windows/Linux) or Command+Z (macOS)
Redo key-combination: Ctrl+Y (Windows/Linux) or Command+Y (macOS)

1 bug: after undoing, new insertions cannot be made.
To do: bug-fixing, implementing word-wrapping (not just general line-wrapping), adding features for down/up arrow key, changing the cursor-position in response to mouse actions, having the GUI only redraw the line, not the whole document 

Most of the project was developed on September 6-11, 18, 23, and 26, 2025.


Thank you for your attention.<br>
