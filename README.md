ALPHA STAGE! The code contains a few glitches.<br>
<b>Description:</b> Implemented in Java: JFrame GUI, character insertion/deletion, cursor-position change (using left/right arrow keys), DoublyLinkedList, word-wrapping, persistent storage.

Yet to do: bug-fixing/glitch-fixing (GUI-cursor-position after word-wrapping, GUI-cursor-position when saving progress and restarting the program)

Thank you for your attention.
