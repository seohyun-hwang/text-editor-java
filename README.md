ALPHA STAGE! The code seems to be free of glitches, but it's not certain. Also, there are more features to be implemented but the basic functionalities are already there.
<b>Description:</b> Implemented in Java: JFrame GUI, character insertion/deletion, cursor-position change (using left/right arrow keys), DoublyLinkedList, line-wrapping, persistent storage.<br>
<b>Practice mission:</b> Constructing LinkedLists out of ArrayLists; coordinating between GUI and behind-the-scenes; the GUI itself; user-input processing; OOP; persistent-storage management

To do: implementing word-wrapping (not just general line-wrapping), adding features for down/up arrow key, changing the cursor-position in response to mouse actions

Thank you for your attention.<br>
