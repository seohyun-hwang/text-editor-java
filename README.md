ALPHA STAGE! The code contains glitches.<br>
<b>Description:</b> Implemented in Java: JFrame GUI, character insertion/deletion, cursor-position change (using left/right arrow keys), DoublyLinkedList, word-wrapping, persistent storage.

Yet to do: glitch-fixing (misplaced GUI-cursor-position when restarting the program after saving progress), adding features for down/up arrow key, changing the cursor-position in response to mouse actions

Thank you for your attention.
